# Grep (very light)

A clone of grep, very lightweight.

This is part of my journey of learning Rust, trying to get the basics right. I'm also following a very good book, [Rust in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/rust-in-action), which elaborates on advanced concepts and things about the language.

# Usage
```
Usage: grep-lite [OPTIONS] --pattern <PATTERN>

Options:
  -e, --pattern <PATTERN>
  -i, --input <INPUT>
  -b, --before <BEFORE>
  -a, --after <AFTER>
  -h, --help               Print help
  -V, --version            Print version
```
